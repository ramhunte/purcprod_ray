## Purchase Production App

This app was designed to allow users to explore purchase and production data for participants in the catch share fishery across at-sea and shoreside sectors. Mothership and catcher-processor sectors do not include landings from vessels participating in the tribal fishery.

The *Summary* tab provides an overview of purchase and production data by value, price, and weight. Total allowable catch is included for context.

The *By Product Type* tab provides production value, price, and weight by product type.
